## 📖 Overview

**E6 Elixir** is a high-stakes financial technology ecosystem built to automate the **Proof of Funds (PoF)** process for international student visa applicants. It is specifically optimized for the **UKVI 28-Day Rule**, ensuring that bank balances are monitored, buffered against FX volatility, and mathematically validated for regulatory submission.

The platform provides a unified bridge between local Nigerian banking (via SMS/USSD/API) and international compliance standards.
